    "# Solute transport and variable-density modelling\r\n",
    "Hi and welcome to workshop six. Fitting all the possible things you can do with solute transport in MF6 in a single session is impossible so we will cover the most commonly applied packages and how to set them up. There is nothing new with regards to how to configure the input data for each package so we will also reference the mf6io.pdf continuously through out the session. This should aid your understanding by filling in the gaps with what won't be demonstrated in here. We will start with the same workshop setup we have been using in each workshop thus far. Then we will construct the Henry Problem, which is a benchmark variable-density problem in groundwater modelling. This will serve as our demonstration model for the complete workshop.\r\n"

    "# The Henry Problem\n",
    "The Henry Problem is a benchmark problem for variable-density modelling codes. It is often the first type of variable-density model that anyone venturing into that space will do. The model itself is relativley simple. A 2D cross-sectional model of a confined aquifer with a constant seaward flux of freshwater from land as the boundary condition on one side of the model and a hydrostatic boundary condition representing the coast on the the other side. Seawater concentrations are assigned to the coastal boundary, which is usually represented as a third-type boundary condition for solutes. This means that flux into the model will be assigned seawater concentrations while flux out of the model will be whatever is calculated by the model."

There will be no change to the flux from the perimeter boundaries and no internal stresses but we cannot run a steady-state flow field because the solutes will affect the density and the density will affect the flow field which will then effect the solutes. Given sufficient iterations and a bit of time the model will achieve a steady-state flow and solute solution characterised by no change in fluid or solute storage with time."

    "# Flow vectors\n",
    "Plotting flow vectors is useful in certain situations. In order to create the vectors flow compnents in each of the principle directions are required. These can be opbtained using the budget file. Note this si not the list budget but the actual budget or .cbb file which you configured in the OC package. The equivalent for solute is the .cbc file which we also configured in the OC package for the GWT model. The first three lines in the code block below show you how to get the component vectors by flagging the \"DATA-SPDIS\" arrays stroed in the budget file. SPDIS stands for specifc discharge and in this case we want the vector components for the last stress period. Those vector compnents are then passed to the plot_vector method to create the vectors on the cross sectional plot (or mapview). The vctors are \"thinned out\" by using the kstep and hstep options in the plot_vector method."

The function below combines the retrieval of concentration information from the concfile object we created earlier with the same plotting approach used for concentration arrays and contours. Also worth pointing out is the format string used for naming each file created by the plotting function. The plot number is formatted using :03d which basically ensures that the number will be 3 digits with leading zeros, i.e., 001, 002, 003 etc."

    "# Using stress package concentrations\n",
    "Note that each transport model in MF6 can only specify one species. When we used auxiliary variables in the GHB and WEL packages we labled them as concentration. This serves as an identifier for the SSM package so that it knows which auxiliary variable is the solute species. Recall you can have as many auxiliary variables as you like in a stress package that supports them. When we use stress package concentration files you don't have to declare an auxiliary variable as an indicator because your are specifying the solute concentrations explicitly through the stress package cocentration file. We will demonstrate this by adding recharge and evapotranspiration across the top of the Henry Problem."

The default behaviour of solute with stress packages is that flux leaves the system the it will do so with whatever concentration the model has calculated.

We can do this using the \"MIXED\" option for the solute behaviour setting. We will assign solute concentrations to the RCH and ET packages via stress package concentration files. These are configured below. The appraoch should be familair to you now where a dictionary is used to specify values for a specific period. We only have one preiod.

There are also solute boundary conditions that fix the concentration and another that increases or decreases solute concentration at a given rate. Both the boundaries have very similar input requirements to the analogoue of their flow boundary conditions, these being fixed head and fixed flux. We will demonstarte the fixed concentration boundary below by adding a block of model cells with a cocentration of 15.0. All of the solute boundaries can also feature a time series of concentration. The remainign options available with each solute boundary package are the same as what is available with the flow packages.   "
