    "# Workshop 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi and welcome to the second workshop. This session will focus on spatial discretisation and introduce you to the Flopy modelgrid object, which is used for exporting model information in various formats. Modflow-6 includes 3-types of grid discretisation namely structured (DIS), vertices (DISV) and unstructured (DISU) that we will explore with Flopy. Also included in this workshop will be an introduction to using Gridgen (get it [here](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables)) to build a quadtree refined model mesh. There are some optional dependencies for Flopy that you will need to have installed in your environment otherwise you may not be able to execute some parts of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to this [webpage](https://flopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md/optional_dependencies.html) to find a list of all Flopy optional dependencies. You will need pyshp, shapely, rasterio (with rasterstats and affine) and scipy."

    "# A structured model grid\n",
    "The structured model grid discretizes space into layers (z), rows (x), and columns (y). This is identical to what was used in all previous versions of MODFLOW excluding MODFLOW-USG. An important difference however is that those previous versions of MODFLOW used finite-differences while MODFLOW-6 uses control-volume finite-differences (also used by MODFLOW-USG). The benefit of using structured grids is it will always satisfy the assumptions of the control-volume finite-difference method. While the other grid types can violate the assumption which leads to some error in the solution. You can read more about this in the MODFLOW-6 user manual (note this is ***not*** the mf6io.pdf document). "

The structured grid allows for the creation of rectangular grids but if your system boundaries don't align with the rectangle then you may want to deactivate those cells. The idomain array therefore has the same number of elements in it as your complete model grid. Values of one indicate active model cells while values of zero are inactive cells. Previous versions of MODFLOW used an array called IBOUND to achieve the same thing. The IBOUND array could also include negative numbers to represent fixed head locations. MODFLOW-6 does not specify fixed heads in this manner. Negative numbers still deactivate the cell but also trigger the formation of a vertical pass through connection, that is, the first active cell above the cell with a negative idomain value will be connected to the first active cell below.

    "The use of control-volume finite-difference facilitates unstructured model grids. Modflow-6 includes two discretization types for this purpose DSIV and DISU. The primary differenrce between the two is that DISU allows for different numbers of nodes/cells in different layers and/or different locations of nodes/cells in different layers. DISV must have the same pattern of nodes and cells in each layer. Instead of (layer, row, column), indexing for nodes, DISV has (layer, node number) while DISU has node number only. You will become more familiar with these differences when we start working with boundary conditions.\n",

    "This allows for more efficient model mesh designs with regards to node numbers. In the following example we will construct a quadtree refined model mesh using Gridgen and Flopy. Gridgen is included in the USGS binaries that you can download from [here](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables).\n",
