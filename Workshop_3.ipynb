    "Hi and welcome to the third workshop. This session will focus on boundary conditions, specifically list type boundary conditions. Some boundary conditions also allow for specifying arrays but we will cover that in the next session along with other array style input packages. You will also be introduced to use and configuration of time series files plus use and configuration of observation files. Additionally, we will introduce specifying auxiliary variables as either multipliers or for transport modelling.  \r\n",

    "# The stress period data dictionary\n",
    "This is arguably the most important part of setting up boundary conditions. Once you grasp how to use and build the information needed in the stress period dictionary, the setup of a basic boundary conditions becomes reasonably straight forward. Whatever variables you see in the MF6io.pdf document between BEGIN PERIOD X and END PERIOD X will have to included in the dictionary. A dictionary is not always necessary as will be demonstrated but learning how to use them will be of benefit when it comes to setting up more complex versions of the same boundary. Boundary conditions are specific to a model so the model object must exist and be provided. Check the options block of whatever boundary condition you want to setup in the MF6io.pdf. Most of the settings in the options block are set with simple entries like option = \"True\", option= None, option = string, option = list_of_strings or option = integer etc. Check the Flopy defaults for each option and make sure you understand what it means to turn different settings on or off."

For the boundaries we will demonstrate in this workshop they are active from the first stress period you designate and will remain active until explicitly deactivated in a subsequent stress period. If you don't designate a stress period in which a boundary condition should first activate then Flopy assumes you want the boundary active throughout the entire simulation.

Here we will demonstrate the use of an auxiliary variable as a multiplier. The nice thing about using the auxiliary variables is that they can be assigned a time series too so instead of a specified value as shown in the example we can also change the entries from numbers to time series names and add those time series to the existing time series file or create completely separate time series files for the different auxiliary variables.
