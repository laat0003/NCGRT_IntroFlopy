    "Hi and welcome to the first of a series of workshops on using MODFLOW-6 with Flopy.\n",
    "To complete this workshop you will need the following:\n",
    "1. The USGS Modflow-6 suite - get it [here](https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/MODFLOW-6/mf6.4.2.zip)\n",
    "2. A Python environment with flopy, numpy, pandas, os, shutil, sys and matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally the Modflow6 execuatble (located in the bin folder of the downloaded suite) should be avaialble system wide otherwise it needs to be placed in the folder where this notebook will running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the mf6io.pdf document that comes with the MF6 suite in the documentation folder. This is the reference document that you should be using to check your model input files and it explains all the different options available to you. This point needs to be emphasized. As the modeller, ***it is your responsibility to check your input files***. Do not presume that because Flopy executed without error that your input files are fine. Flopy is a tool to help you create those files – it can still produce input files that will cause your model to fail.\n",
