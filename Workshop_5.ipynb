    "# Workshop 5\r\n",
    "Hi and welcome to the fifth workshop. In this session we will take a look at a couple of the advanced stress packages because they tend to have input requirements that are somewhat uncommon to the regular stress packages. Specifically, we will focus on the lake package (LAK) and the multi-aquifer well package (MAW) to demonstrate how the different data requirements for these packages are developed and used in Flopy objects. We picked the MAW because of applicability and the LAK because it also introduces cell connectivity data input similar to the GWF-GWF package used for linking multiple models in MF6. Once you have a grasp of the input requirements for these packages the remaining advanced stress packages should not pose a significant obstacle. In addition to the advanced stress package creation, we will introduce some of the inbuilt post-processing capabilities of Flopy and provide applied use examples of how they can be used to good effect\r\n"

    "# The Lake Package (LAK)\r\n",
    "The lake package can have different configurations within a model. We will only demonstrate the explicit approach, the reasons for which will become obvious as we do it. The explicit method requires that you deactivate model cells that comprise the lake and then create connections to the lake from the cells adjacent to those that were deactivated. Cell connection information is available via the discretization packages. It should be clear that with a structured model grid this is relatively straight forward but could become very complex with an unstructured or vertices type grid. We're going to setup a lake in the mine pit that we plotted cross sections for. So the first step will be to figure out which cells are inside our lake void and then deactivate them via IDOMAIN. Note this is not as simple as using the polygon to select boundary cells because now we have to account for 3 dimensions.\r\n"

    "# The connection data\r\n",
    "This is the trickiest bit. However, if you get a feel for how to assign connections with the LAK package then you also know how to tackle nested models because the principle is the same. It may seem difficult but if you can grasp what information is stored in your modelgrid and how to access it then it can make your life much easier. To begin with we need to know what are the nodes adjacent to the inactive nodes. In a structured grid you could do a simple test because using unit increases or decreases in row and column to see if a neighbour of a deactivated cell is active thereby signalling a connection. With DISV and DISU we don't know the node numbers adjacent to our inactive cells, so how can we find teses ou?. Te followingscode blocks  serves as nt example for the benefits of a scripted modelling workflow.Unless the GUI you are using instead has a similar method for doing this you would have to set up all your connections by hand. Very painful.  Warning, this can be a bit of a brain drain so we'll take it slow.\r\n"
